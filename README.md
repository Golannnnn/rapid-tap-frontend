# Rapid Tap Frontend

A fun tapping game built with React on the frontend, NodeJS on the backend and MongoDB as a database.

This project was built together with my good and talented friends: [Or Ayash](https://github.com/Ayashor) and [Diego Pilosof](https://github.com/diegopilosof). Together we had around a week and a half to build this project as part of the curriculum of ITC. The backend for this project can be found [here](https://github.com/Golannnnn/pet-adoption-be).
